* I used these links for my notification system project with Windows powershell
and ATOM IDE.
* As you know, you can see on package.json what I installed. Because I installed so
many things with npm and then I uninstalled unnecessary things so I cant remember the
last version. :(
NOTE: I installed react-bootstrap but its unnecessary. I've never used it.
* Its not perfect sample but you can use like prototype. I hope it will help you!
