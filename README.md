* I used these links for my notification system project with Windows powershell
and ATOM IDE.

*I used npm;
-react
-babel (has JSX)
-webpack(has also css,minify,html,bundle)
-materialize

So I dowloaded these packages for an optimized notification system. 
* Its not perfect sample but you can use like prototype. I hope it will help you!
